## My process

Process ran smoothly, the part i'm still findind a bit complex is the box positioning, the spacing between elements in this project bothered me a little. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

On my next projects i would like to implement flexbox to increase productivity and be up to do date with the newer tech.

I want to start implementing JS on my web pages but I'm still unconfortable with it. And start as soom as possible developing more than lading pages, multi-paged interfaces are the next goal.

### Useful resources

- [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/pt/create/color-wheel) - This was used to find and create a color pallette that suited what i wanted better.
